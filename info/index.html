  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ul>

      winner of the day.</li>
    <li>You must click the link to join the giveaway</li>
    <li>Winners are picked at random. For your nerds out there, we're picking the first row that comes back from ORDER BY RAND()
      [Yes, you can win multiple times]</li>
    <li>We will NOT spam you/sell your data, only asking you if you wish to join and if you have won.</li>
  </ul>
